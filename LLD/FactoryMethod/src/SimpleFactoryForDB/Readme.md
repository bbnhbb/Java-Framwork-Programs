# Simple Factory 
- here in simple factory 
  - send email has only code to send the email
  - Database driver is collected from Database driver factory getDatabaseDriver() 
    - return type for this method is DatabaseDriver interface
- Design principles
  - Follows
    - Dry - as database can be used anywhere else
    - SRP 
  - Not follow
    - Open Close - always we have to modify databasefactory but not email class
    - Maintainable
- Simple factory is usefull if we have minimum classes 
  - like old and new tax regime 
  - But in case of databases we have to many of them will not be good to use
- So we have factory method
